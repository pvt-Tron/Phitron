Hardware
Hardware refers to the computer's tangible components or delivery systems that store and run the written instructions
 provided by software; Hardware are the external and internal devices and equipments that enable to perform major
functions such as input, output, storage, communications, processing, and more (Computer Hardware are external or internal).
CPU Central Processing Unit (included imodules are: Mem RAM (Random Accsess Memory),
ALU (Aritmetic Logical Unit [was: Math Coprocessor ]), CU (Contro Unit)).
Memory (Temporary[]volatile or Permanet),
E-E-P-ROM (Elcetrical Erase Print Read [Only] Memory). (ref: Javapoint, Geek for Geek, P.H.)

Sofware
Is a set of program that enable Systems to perform specific tasks. System, Application & Programming Software.
BIos/Uefi, Firmwares, Device Drivers, Operating Systems, Programming Language Translators, Utilites, Tools & more
BIOS = Basic In/Out System; UEFI =  Unified Extended Firmware Interface; (ref: Javapoint, P.H.). Programming Software
 Develop Debug and Mantain Applications and others Softwaares.
Programming : VS Code, Sublime Text, Vim, Gnu Emacs, Spyder, Atom, Jupiter, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Notepad ++.
Network & Internet
Internet is a global network. IP address x.x.x.x is a TCP/IP unique address on a local and/or global network.
IPv4 (1981) 32bit >> 4.3 billion of possible addresses  > IPv6(2012) 128bit >> 340 undicillion of possible addresses.
DNS is Dynamic Name Resolution System convert adresses names www.domain.com  to IP addr.  111.111.111.111.
